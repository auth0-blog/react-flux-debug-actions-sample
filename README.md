# React - Debugging Flux Actions

Source code for the blog post: [Logging & Debugging in React with Flux: Replaying your userâ€™s actions](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/08/25/logging-and-debugging-in-react-with-flux-replaying-your-users-actions/)

## Using it

- [ ] First start the backend: `npm run backend` (which will listen on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)).
- [ ] Then start the web application: `npm run dev` (which will run on [http://localhost:4501/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:4501/webpack-dev-server/)).

Once you have everything running you can start the app in 2 browser windows:

 - In the first window, you'll be an end user. If you delete the third item, the app will crash.
 - In the second window, you'll be a developer. Click the DEBUG button on the top right, choose to replay the end user's session and look at your Console. You'll see the error of the end user.

## How does it work?

* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
